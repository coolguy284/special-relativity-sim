Can choose to follow either MIT or Unlicense; MIT made available in case
Unlicense does not legally apply in your jurisdiction.

Note: the file "js_lib/gl-matrix-min.js" is an external library created
by someone else. Thus, the MIT+Unlicense of this repository does not apply
to that file. The file instead uses its own license, which appears at the
top of the file, and is the MIT license but with that file's author and an
earlier copyright date.
